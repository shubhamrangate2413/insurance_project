# insurance_project

The aim of this project is to provide a practical overview of the general DS/ML workflow, which is becoming an increasingly popular framework upon which modern-day actuarial pricing methods are being built. Accurate pricing is currently one of the most crucial challenges that businesses across the insurance industry are facing, where providing accurate estimates of loss costs is vital to ensuring prudent insurance portfolio management and maintaining successful financial performance, especially as the sector is currently experiencing a swelling volume of claims - for example, regarding business interruption - as one of the major consequences of COVID-19.

As a case study, we will introduce some supervised ML techniques for predicting claim severities on a French motor third-party liability (MTPL) insurance dataset.

You can find the dataset at MTPL_filepath = "/kaggle/input/fremtpl-french-motor-tpl-insurance-claims/"
